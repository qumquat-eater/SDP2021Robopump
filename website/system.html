            <h1>Concept</h1>
            <p>RoboPump is a robotic gas station assistant that automatically fuels the user's car. RoboPump is focused on increasing the accessibility and convenience of gas stations through eliminating as many of the time consuming motor tasks as possible. <br><br> A typical use case for RoboPump would be: the user pulls into the gas station, opens their fuel hatch and inputs their desired type and amount fuel into the app and selects 'Start Fuelling'. After receiving this message RoboPump will spring into action; using vision algorithms to detect the open fuel hatch and proceed to unscrew the fuel cap, insert the pump and fuel the vehicle. After RoboPump has reinserted the fuel cap the user can close their fuel hatch and then drive off.</p>        <video width="764" height="430" controls>

                        </video>
 <br> <p>The RoboPump system is carefully designed to be as accessible as possible for disabled drivers but can still be used by non-disabled users craving a more convenient fueling experience. Sales of RoboPump units are targeted towards gas stations and downloading of the app is targeted towards drivers.</p>

            <h2><a href="#Functionality">Functionality</a></h2>
                        <p>RoboPump includes many exciting features to maximise accessibility and convenience.       </p>
                        <h3><u> App </u> </h3>
<p>The complete RoboPump system includes an android application that can take users from profile creation to pump activation all from the comfort of their own seat. Working closely with our accessibility expert, Ryan Bowler, has allowed to develop a highly accessible and usable app, ensuring a broad customer base. Measures taken include our slick monochrome interface and clear design language. <br><br> Features include: <ol><li>Creating multiple profiles -- allowing for easy use of RoboPump to fuel other user's cars</li><li>TCP communication with the robot to maximise reliability</li><li>Simple and understandable navigation allowing fuelling in just a couple of clicks</li> </ol>  </p> <div>

<h3><u>Robot</u></h3>
<p> Of course, the RoboPump system also includes the robotic arm responsible for fuelling. Mainly powered by the vision algorithms we have developed, RoboPump can fuel a generic car in a wide variety of positions. Thanks to extensive safety testing, RoboPump is integrated with multiple safety features and considerations suitable for a safety critical system; ensuring user's can remain confident in its operation.<br><br> RoboPump is capable of actions such as: <ol><li> Detecting the open fuel hatch of a vehicle</li><li>Unscrewing and re-screwing the fuel cap of a vehicle</li><li>Inserting the fuel nozzle into and fuelling a vehicle</li> </ol> </p>
