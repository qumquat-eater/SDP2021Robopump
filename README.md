# SDP2021Robopump

Our system, RoboPump, was designed as an assistive robot to help users with the daily task of fuelling their cars. Our system has successfully eliminated most of the key physical interactions involved with fuelling a car. We believe by removing these motor tasks we have built a system that can benefit users with disabilities as well as allowing the general public to continue with common activities such as work calls and handling young children or other passengers in the car. Simultaneously, we reduce the number of contact points for a more hygienic experience.

Here is also a short demo video!
